# hello-world
Developing my programming experiences with GITHUB in Websites and Visual Basic for Windows Form, as well as getting codes on my personal sites.
I am a College Lecturer at present while reading educational technology for a research course in deleloping elearning courses using codes, contents and platforms for online 
presentation technologies. Glad to use GITHUB to understanding coding and using them on my own/self platforms where possible. Thanks.
